Everything you need can be found in [src](https://github.com/metricio/metricio/blob/master/src). Just open up each folder with your text editor and make your changes.

If you aren't too familiar with React, Node.js or SCSS, you should still be able to find your way around. The current widgets, dashboards and jobs use very simple and easy to understand patterns.  But if you get stuck, just raise an issue in the Github project.

| **Path** | **Description** |
|:--|:--|
| **/src/dashboards/** | Where all dashboards should be created. A [default](https://github.com/metricio/metricio/blob/master/src/dashboards/index.jsx) dashboard is already available as an example. See [dashboards](/dashboards) for more information. |
| **/src/widgets/** | Contains all currently available widgets. You can create your own or use the [existing](https://github.com/metricio/metricio/blob/master/src/widgets) ones. See [widgets](/widgets) for more information. |
| **/src/jobs/** | Contains all currently available jobs. You should create your own but feel free to use the [existing](https://github.com/metricio/metricio/blob/master/src/jobs) ones as a template.  See [jobs](/jobs) for more information. |
